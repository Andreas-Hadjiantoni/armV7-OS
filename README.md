# armV7-OS

This is a minimal Operating System for the armV7 architecture. The following were implemented:

1) Preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling using multilevel feedback queues.
2) **Fork**, **exec**, **kill** and **exit** system calls.
3) Inter Process Communication(IPC)
4) Implemented and solved the [Dining Philosophers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem) problem such that each philosopher is represented by its own process, to demonstrate the IPC functionality.
